1. Here we place all objects at the position with Y = 0.

2. Then we generate meshes with bend potential 70% and ground offset different for every object:
	Capsule: ground offset = 0.9
	Cube: ground offset = 0.5
	Cylinder: ground offset = 1
	Sphere: ground offset = 0.4

3. Check how the objects are placed on the Terrain and how they are bending.
