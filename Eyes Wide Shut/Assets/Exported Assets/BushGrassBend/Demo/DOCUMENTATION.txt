1. Open the tool window: click on Tools/Prepare detail for bend

2. The GameObject (your bush or grass object) to edit should be located on the scene at the world position 0, 0, 0.

3. Drag and drop the desired GameObject from the scene to the GameObject parameter.

4. By default the bend potential is 70%, you can play with that value as you wish, but for the first test I recommend to leave it between 70% and 100%.
	
5. You can change the ground Y offset and preview the appearance.

6. Finally click on Save and choose the desired location for the new Mesh that will be attached to the GameObject automatically.

7. Create a new prefab from the modified GameObject.

8. Add this prefab as a Detail Mesh (Render Mode - Grass) to the Terrain. Place some instances in the Terrain with this Detail Mesh.

9. Ready for tests.
